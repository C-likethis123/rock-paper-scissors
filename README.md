# rock-paper-scissors
My attempt at creating a Rock Paper Scissors game, for the Odin Project. This took me two days in total to complete two major milestones. 
The first milestone: create a console Rock Paper Scissors game. It took me a day to complete this milestone. 
The second milestone: give it simple UI. It took me a day to complete this as well.

# Reflections
Through this project, I have the opportunity to showcase my Javascript skills. I also learnt how to manipulate the DOM via Javascript and learnt about handling events. 

# Future improvements
Here are some improvements I think could be made:
* Improve the UI by adding a style.css file
* Adding more graphics to the UI 
* Using a framework like JQuery for DOM manipulation
